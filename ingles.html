<h2><big><font color="#085E8A">¿What are Biogas?</font></big></h2></center>
<p>Biogas is the only renewable energy that can be used for any of the major energy applications: electrical, thermal or as fuel.<br>
Biogas is a type of renewable gas that is obtained from organic waste from industries such as food, agriculture or livestock.<br>
Basically, wherever there is biodegradable organic matter (that decomposes) it is possible to obtain this advanced biofuel.<br>
Biogas is obtained from organic waste, since biodegradation of plant residues similar to that described occurs in them.<br>
The production of biogas by anaerobic decomposition is a useful way of treating biodegradable waste, as it produces a valuable fuel,<br>
in addition to generating an effluent that can be applied as a soil conditioner or generic fertilizer.</p>
<center><h2><big><font color="#085E8A">Biodogestors</font></big></h2></center>
<p>A biodigester is a container or tank (hermetically closed) that is loaded with organic waste. Inside, the decomposition of organic matter occurs<br>
to generate biogas, a fuel with which you can cook, heat water and produce electrical energy, using a gas generator.<br>
The main function of the biodigester is precisely this, to treat the wastewater so that when it is expelled into the environment it causes the minimum<br>
 impact on soil contamination, avoids bad odors and therefore prevents the generation of infectious organisms that cause.</p>

<td>These are closed containers in which the waste biodegradation process does not end until all the possible biogas has been produced. One of their advantages
is that they can contain a large load of materials while requiring little water.</td>
